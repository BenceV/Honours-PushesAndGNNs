# Honours Project Repository

Welcome to my the main repository of my Honours Project. Here you can find almost every piece of code I have worked on throughout the entirety of the project. 
The code base is distributed in to 3 distinct phases:
* Phase 1: Initial experimentations
* Phase 2: Rigidbody experiments
* Phase 3: Realworld Data experiments

Each of these phases can be considered a milestone in the project and are placed into their own branches inside the repository.
